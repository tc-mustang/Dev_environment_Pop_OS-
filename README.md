Finally, adding all the steps to do a dual boot on work computer plus essential package installation
To avoid all future headaches, I'm having one today:

## Download Pop_OS! and create a usb drive using the 'Disks' Utility (on another pop_os) if in Windows use Balena etcher.

## Turn off secure boot [F1 to start the BIOS on Lenovo X1 Carbon]

## Partition the hard drive on Windows (I do this on Windows just to play it safe)
  - Right click on disk management and select Disk management
  - Right click in the partition you want to use and click 'shrink volume'
  - Under 'Enter the amount of space to shrink in Mb' Add the size of the disk you want to create
  - ready
  
## Install Pop_OS! in the unallocated partition
  - Start the PC on the boot menu [F12 work on Lenovo X1 Carbon]
